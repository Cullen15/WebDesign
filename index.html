  <h1>Free Solo Documentary</h1>

  <h3>Chapter 1: Introduction</h3>
  <p>
    Free Solo introduces Alex Honnold, a climber with an insane goal, to climb El Capitan without any ropes or safety gear. 
    Right from the start, you can see how focused and fearless he is. I love how the film mixes crazy scenery with his 
    personal story—it immediately pulls you in and makes you wonder how anyone could do something so extreme.
  </p>

  <h3>Chapter 2: Training and Preparation</h3>
  <p>
    This part shows all the work Alex puts in before the big climb. He practices the route over and over, studies every crack 
    in the rock, and pushes himself mentally and physically. Watching this made me realize just how much discipline it takes. 
    It’s not just about strength—it’s about focus, patience, and trusting yourself completely.
  </p>

  <h3>Chapter 3: The Climb</h3>
  <p>
    The actual climb is intense. Every move Alex makes feels dangerous, and the camera makes you feel like you’re right there 
    with him. I was on the edge of my seat the whole time. The way he stays calm and precise, even in situations that would 
    terrify anyone else, is incredible. It’s exciting, nerve-wracking, and inspiring all at once.
  </p>

  <h3>Chapter 4: Reflection</h3>
  <p>
    After he finishes, the film takes a step back to show the human side of all this. You see the risks he took, how it 
    affected his relationships, and the mental challenges behind being one of the best climbers in the world. I liked this part 
    because it shows that even someone who seems superhuman has doubts and feelings, which makes his achievement even more 
    impressive.
