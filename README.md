# Assignment 2 Reflection

## How are you doing?
I’m doing pretty good. This project helped me practice linking multiple pages together, and it felt easier after doing the first assignment.

## Can I do anything specifically to help you inside and/or outside of class?
Maybe just more examples of CSS tricks for layout (like spacing and aligning). That always helps me see what’s possible.

## How did this module go for you?
It went well! I enjoyed adding new pages and trying out different styles. It’s cool seeing how CSS can really change the look and feel of a website.
